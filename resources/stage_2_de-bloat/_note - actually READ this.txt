There are four files in this directory that determine what Tron targets for bloatware removal:

1. programs_to_target_by_name.txt
2. programs_to_target_by_GUID.bat
3. toolbars_BHOs_to_target_by_GUID.bat
4. OEM_modern_apps_to_target_by_name.ps1

You can customize any of these files to tweak what Tron targets for removal.


# programs_to_target_by_name.txt

 Insert program NAMES, one per line, into the file. Tron will try to uninstall any program
 whose name matches one of the names in this file. Don't put any special characters around 
 the name (quotes, commas, etc). Spaces are fine. Tron uses WMI queries inside a batch file,
 so the wildcard character is double-percent (%%).

Example list:
    Cyberlink%%
    Dell Getting Started Guide%%
    Dell Video%%
    %%Toolbar%%

So in this example,  Dell%%  would catch and attempt to remove both "Dell Getting Started Guide" AND "Dell Video."


#  programs_to_target_by_GUID.bat

 List specific GUIDs to target, one per line. This file is batch (not flat text). The reason it's
 batch instead of plain text is so you can put comments over each GUID describing what it is.
 

 
#  toolbars_BHOs_to_target_by_GUID.bat

 List specific GUIDs to target, one per line. This file is batch instead of plain text as well.
 It's separate from programs_to_target_by_GUID.bat just for organization; Tron executes both files
 the same way.
 
 
 
#  OEM_modern_apps_to_target_by_name.ps1

 This is a Powershell script listing pre-loaded OEM "Modern" apps. Add any Windows 10 "Modern" apps
 you want to remove to this list.




 !! NOTE !!

Many programs do not register with WMI and so can't be targeted with this method.
For those programs, you'll have to manually remove them. 
This stage is just a "best-effort" attempt to automate some of the tedium.

Godspeed
