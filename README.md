| BACKGROUND | Why the name Tron? Tron "Fights for the User"                                               |

I got tired of running these utilities manually and decided to just automate everything, so Tron basically automates a variety of tasks to clean up/disinfect a Windows machine.


# USE

1. Boot into Safe Mode with Network Support (Safe Mode is NOT required but is strongly recommended)

2. Copy `tron.bat` and the `\resources` folder to the target machine and run `tron.bat` as an **ADMINISTRATOR**.

   Tron will refuse to run if you don't run as an Administrator.

3. Wait anywhere from **3-10 hours** (yes, it really does take that long).

4. By default the log file is at `C:\Logs\tron.log`

Tron will briefly check for a newer version when it starts up and notify you if one is found. Depending on how badly the system is infected, it could take anywhere from 3 to 10 hours to run. I've personally observed times between 4-8 hours, and one user reported a run time of 30 hours. Basically set it and forget it.


# SAFE MODE

Microsoft, in their long-standing tradition of breaking useful, heavily-used functionality for no reason, changed how you get into Safe Mode for Windows 8, disabling the traditional F8 method. Tron re-enables the F8 method as part of it's prep tasks (before actually running), but here's how to manually re-enable the old-style boot menu that supports the F8 key. From an admin command prompt, run this command:

    bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy

Reboot and you should now be able to use F8 to select Safe Mode. Note that this command is the same one Tron runs, so if you launch Tron to the menu and then exit, you'll accomplish the same thing.


# COMMAND-LINE USE

Command-line use is fully supported. All flags are optional and can be combined. *

    tron.bat [-a -c -d -m -o -p -q -r -s -v -x] | [-h]

    -a  Automatic mode (no welcome screen or prompts; implies -e)

    -c  Config dump (display current config. Can be used with other
        flags to see what WOULD happen, but script will never execute
        if this flag is used)

    -d  Dry run (run through script without executing any jobs)
    
    -e  Accept EULA (suppress display of disclaimer warning screen)

    -h  Display help text
    
    -m  Preserve default Metro apps (don't remove them)

    -o  Power off after running (overrides -r if used together)

    -p  Preserve power settings (don't reset power settings to default)
    
    -q  Quiet. Don't audibly speak when starting and finishing

    -r  Reboot automatically (auto-reboot 30 seconds after completion)

    -s  Skip defrag (force Tron to ALWAYS skip Stage 5 defrag)

    -v  Verbose. Show as much output as possible. NOTE: Significantly slower!
    
    -x  Self-destruct. Tron deletes itself after running and leaves logs intact
   
* There is no UDM flag

# CHANGE DEFAULTS (advanced)

Defaults are always overridden by command-line flags, but if you don't want to use the command-line and don't like Tron's defaults, you can edit the script and change the following default variables:

- To change log location, edit these lines:

  ```
  set LOGPATH=%SystemDrive%\Logs
  set LOGFILE=tron.log
  ```
  
- To change where Tron stores quarantined files, change this path (note: this is currently unused by Tron, so setting it has no effect):
  ```
  set QUARANTINE_PATH=C:\path\to\your\desired\folder
  ```

- To always run automatically (no welcome screen), change this to `yes`:

  ```
  set AUTORUN=no
  ```

- To always do a dry run (don't actually execute jobs), change this to `yes`:

  ```
  set DRY_RUN=no
  ```
  
- To permanently accept the End User License Agreement (suppress display of disclaimer warning screen), change this to `yes`:
  ```
  set EULA_ACCEPTED=no
  ```

- To preserve default Metro apps (don't remove them), change this to `yes`:
  
  ```
  set PRESERVE_METRO_APPS=no
  ```

- To shut down the computer when Tron is finished, change this to `yes`:

  ```
  set AUTO_SHUTDOWN=no
  ```

- To preserve the power scheme (instead of resetting to Windows defaults), change this to `yes`:
  
  ```
  set PRESERVE_POWER_SCHEME=no
  ```

- To prevent Tron from audibly announcing when starting and finishing, change this to `yes`:
  ```
  set SHUT_UP=no
  ```

- To configure post-run reboot, change this value (in seconds). `0` disables auto-reboot:

  ```
  set AUTO_REBOOT_DELAY=0
  ```
  
- To **ALWAYS** skip defrag, regardless whether `C:\` is an SSD or not, change this line to read `yes`:

  ```
  set SKIP_DEFRAG=no
  ```

- To display as much output as possible (verbose), change this to `yes`:

  ```
  set VERBOSE=no
  ```

- To have Tron delete itself after running (self-destruct), change this to `yes`:

  ```
  set SELF_DESTRUCT=no
  ```

* There is no -UPM flag


# INTEGRITY

In every release `checksums.txt` is signed with my PGP key (`0x82A211A2`, included). You can use it to verify package integrity.


# LICENSE

Tron and any associated bootstrapper scripts and `.reg` files that I've written are free to use/redistribute/whatever under the **MIT license**. It'd be nice if you sent an email and let me know if you do something cool with it, but it's not required.


# OTHER

I try to keep everything updated. If you notice some of the packages are out of date (e.g. Java, which updates at the frequency of every 3 minutes), PM me on reddit or send me an email (listed above). I respond pretty quickly most days.

Hope this is helpful to other PC techs,

# FULL TRON DESCRIPTION

## tron.bat
Master script that launches all the other tools. It performs a lot of actions on its own, but for any task we can't perform directly, it calls an external utility or script.


## Tron prep jobs

1. **Detect SSD**: Detect solid state hard drives. If found, tron skips the **Stage 5 defrag**

2. **Detect Safe Mode**: Detect whether or not we're in Safe Mode and notifies the user if we're not

3. **Enable F8 Safe Mode selection**: Re-enable the ability to use the `F8` key on bootup (Windows 8/8.1 only; enabled by default on Server 2012/2012 R2)

4. **Make log and quarantine dirs**: Create the `LOGPATH` and `QUARANTINE_PATH` directories if they don't already exist

5. **Check for update**: Use `wget` to pull down md5sums.txt from the Tron mirror and see if we're on the current version


## STAGE 0: Prep

1. **Rkill**: Rkill is an anti-malware prep tool; it looks for and kills a number of known malware that interfere with removal tools

2. **ProcessKiller**: Utility provided by /u/cuddlychops06 which kills various userland processes. We use this to further kill anything that might interfere with Tron

3. **TDSS Killer**: Anti-rootkit utility from Kaspersky Labs. Tron calls TDSSKiller with the following flags:

  ```
  -l %TEMP%\tdsskiller.log -silent -tdlfs -dcexact -accepteula -accepteulaksn
  ```

4. **erunt**: Used to backup the registry before beginning a Tron run

5. **VSS purge**: Purges oldest set of Volume Shadow Service files (basically snapshot-in-time copies of files). Malware can often hide out here

6. **Disable sleep mode**: Tron disables sleep mode when the script starts to prevent going to sleep. At the end of the script it resets power settings to Windows defaults, unless you run with the -p flag

7. **Check and repair WMI**: Check the WMI interface and attempt repair if broken. Tron uses WMI for a lot of stuff including ISO date format conversion, OEM bloatware removal, and various other things, so having it functioning is critical

8. **nircmd.exe**: Third-party utility designed for system administrators. Tron uses this for the speak function (audibly announcing beginning and end times). Using the -q flag will prevent the use of this


## STAGE 1: Tempclean

1. **Internet Explorer cleanup**: Runs built-in Windows tool to clean and reset Internet Explorer:

  ```
  rundll32.exe inetcpl.cpl,ClearMyTracksByProcess 4351
  ```

2. **CCLeaner**: CCLeaner utility by Piriform. Used to clean temp files before running AV scanners

3. **BleachBit**: BleachBit utility. Used to clean temp files before running AV scanners

4. **TempFileClean**: Script I wrote to clean some areas that other tools seem to miss

5. **Clear Windows event logs**: Backs up Windows event logs by default to the LOGPATH directory, then clears all log files

6. **Clear Windows Update cache**: Purges uninstaller files for already-installed Windows Updates. Typically frees up quite a bit of space


## STAGE 2: Disinfect

1. **RogueKiller**: anti-rootkit utility and anti-malware prep tool. Similar to rkill

2. **Sophos Virus Removal Tool**: Command-line anti-virus scanner. Runs in debug mode for more verbose output

3. **Vipre Rescue Scanner**: Command-line anti-virus scanner

4. **Malwarebytes Anti-Malware**: Anti-malware scanner. Because there is no command-line support for MBAM, we simply install it and continue with the rest of the script. This way a tech can click **Scan** whenever they're around, but the script doesn't stall while waiting for user input

5. **DISM image check & repair**: Microsoft utility for checking the Windows Image Store (basically like System File Checker on crack). Windows 8 and up only

6. **System File Checker**: Microsoft utility for checking the filesystem for errors and attempting to repair if found. Tron runs this on Windows Vista and up only (XP and below require a reboot)


## STAGE 3: De-bloat

1. **OEM de-bloat**: Use WMI to attempt to uninstall any program listed in this file:

  ```
  \resources\stage_3_de-bloat\oem\programs_to_target.txt
  ```

2. **Metro de-bloat**: Remove the built-in Metro apps that no one uses (stuff like Calculator, Paint etc is not removed). Purges them from the cache (can always fetch from Windows Update later)


## STAGE 4: Patch
Tron installs or updates these programs:

1. **7-zip**: Open-source compression and extraction tool. Far superior to just about everything (including the venerable WinRAR)

2. **Adobe Flash Player**: Used by YouTube and various other sites

3. **Adobe Reader**: Standard PDF reader

4. **Java Runtime Environment**: I hate Java, but it is still widely used so we at least get the system on the latest version

5. **Notepad++**: Open-source text editor with syntax highlighting

6. **Windows updates**: Self-explanatory

7. **DISM base reset**: Recompiles the "Windows Image Store" after we finished purging old files from it earlier. Windows 8 and up only


## STAGE 5: Optimize

1. **chkdsk**: Checks disk for errors and schedules a chkdsk with repair at next reboot

2. **Defraggler**: Command-line defrag tool from Piriform


## STAGE 6: Manual tools
Tron does not run these automatically because most of them don't support command-line use.

1. **ADSSpy**: Scans for hidden ADS streams

2. **AdwCleaner**: Popular user-suggested adware removal tool

3. **aswMBR**: Rootkit scanner

4. **autoruns**: Examine and remove programs that run at startup

5. **ComboFix**: The "scorched-earth policy" of malware removal

6. **gmer**: Rootkit/ADS scanner

7. **Junkware Removal Tool**: Temp files and random junkware remover

8. **ServicesRepair.exe**: ESET utility for fixing broken Windows services

9. **TempFileCleaner**: OldTimer utility for cleaning temp files

10. **VirusTotal uploader tool**: Uploads a file directly to VirusTotal for scanning
